# Dark Hole üï≥

A set of scripts to remove your social media presence.

## About

Protecting your social media presence can be challenging. What happens when Twitter (now X) becomes unsafe, or Reddit destroys its open source community by pricing out third party apps?

Dark Hole allows you to vote with your data and remove your posts, likes, bookmarks, and the like. This critical act enables ordinary people to slowly reduce the value of unsafe platforms as more people indulge their data rights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> None of these scripts store, process, or send any data to a third party or the maintainer.

Please view the scripts for yourself - they are written to be as understandable as possible. The only data exchange that ever happens is on the platform itself (e.g., deletion of posts).

## Usage

When a script is installed, it only runs on a specific page (for instance, Twitter Bookmarks). You will see a popup with a ( `üßπ Begin Removal` ) button. Press the button and sit back. Leave the page / tab open so it can run. To exit the script, press <kbd>‚êõ</kbd> (escape key).

## Install

Add the [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension to Chrome.
